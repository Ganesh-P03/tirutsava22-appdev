**"Never miss an event, and always be informed"**

## LOST/FOUND

> > Uses:

It's also a typical occurrence for us to forget or lose anything (like we keep at some place and forget to take it back with us).

In this circumstance, we usually ask everyone if they know anything about the object we've lost.
What if we had a platform where you could notify everyone in your community that you had lost something?

This can be done using this app.
